    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p> The objective of this assignment asks us to think critically about embodiment and our own embodied interactions with the digital tools and environments that populate their daily lives. We will engage in auto-ethnographic research by observing and documenting our firsthand experience of a particular digital interaction.
        I decided to chose my firsthand experience with Spotify as it is something I use alot in my life daily.

<h3>Reflect</h3>
<p>I decided to research my interaction with the Spotify app which is Anne up that I use daily to listen to music and podcast. And I started my assignment by researching and collect collecting data by different sources of mean one being jotting down the songs that I listened to and using apps such as spotty starts, last.FM, Discover quickly, Skiley, Whisperify, Obscurify music as well as screen timer which helped me collect data of the last four weeks of Spotify.</p> 
<br>
<p>In my draft, I put the Spotify logo in between and show the different stats. But I did not feel too connected to the app.</p>
<br>
<p>In the final design, I tried to match the theme of the Spotify app and go with the colour scheme being black, white and green which made me feel that it was interactive. Most of the songs and artists are in Hindi and are Indian. It was a fun process over all.</p>
