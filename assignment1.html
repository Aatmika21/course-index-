    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of this assignment was to make a 24" by 36" poster about either our life under covid-19 or how we see the future of design *without using software explicitly intended for design.* Meaning we are not allowed to use any adobe software print design and production in your process.
    </p>
    <p> I chose my life under covid-19.</p>

    <h3>Reflect</h3>
    <p>The thought process behind the poster was all the things that I did during the lockdown and showing the months on the calendar to show the month passed away while waiting for the lockdown to be over. I decided to show different things that help me cope with the COVID-19.</p>
<br>
<p>In the beginning, I was planning to make my poster by only using the major things that I did during the lockdown such as watching Netflix and creating a collage out of all the shows that I watched. I created that by taking screenshots and assembling them on Instagram and using filters.</p>
<br>
<p>For the final poster, I decided to collect all the smallest things that I did which made me pass through the covid lockdown and also appreciate such as chats or voice notes with my friends, all the movies that I watched, the songs that I listened to and places that I was able to visit. I created all that by taking screenshots on my laptop and assembling them together on my desktop and taking a screenshot of the whole project.it was not an easy project but it was super fun as there was no limit to creativity.</p> 
<br>
<p>This project had a lot of creativity and challenge at the same time as we were not able to use design programs which helped in opening eyes and showing how much a designer is dependent upon design programs. This project was not an easy task, but it made me value the effort that is put behind it.</p>
